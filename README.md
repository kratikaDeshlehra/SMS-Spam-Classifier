# SMS-Spam-Classifier
An SMS Spam Classifier that leverages machine learning to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages (ham). The project involves preprocessing text data, feature extraction using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and building a classification model to accurately identify spam messages.

# Features
User-friendly Interface: Allows users to input an SMS message and get instant predictions.
Model-based Predictions: The backend uses a trained machine learning model to classify the message.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/kratikaDeshlehra/SMS-Spam-Classifier.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd SMS-Spam-Classifier
3. Install the dependencies:
You can install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4.Run the Application
To run the Streamlit app, execute the following command in the project directory:
streamlit run app.py
This will start the Streamlit app.

# How it Works
Input Message: Enter an SMS message in the provided text box.
Model Prediction: The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify the message as either "spam" or "not spam".
Output: The classification result is displayed on the screen.
